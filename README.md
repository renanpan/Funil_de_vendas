## Project 10

This project is about my bootcamp of data analysis where I must check the users behavior on the company app.

### About the files
 - The 'sprint_10_project' file is the main project written using jupyter notebook.
 - The 'logs_exp_us' file contains all the data for the project.

### Executing it

To execute the project I recommend you download the files and save in a folder in your computer. Make sure to have both files in the same folder and then open the 'sprint_10_project' using VS Code, for example, and then run the code.
